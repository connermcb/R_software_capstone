## Significant Earthquakes Application

### Introduction
This application is a software package that can be used to work with the [NOAA Significant Earthquakes dataset](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1). This dataset has a substantial amount of information embedded in it that may not be immediately accessible to people without knowledge of the intimate details of the dataset or of R. The application provides the tools for processing and visualizing the data so that others may extract some use out of the information embedded within.

### The Data
The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.
